            </div>
            <p>Our founders, known as Skinny Santa and Kid, were born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta Canada.
                Skinny Santa started skiing when he was 10, and loved it! Over the following years he continued to ski
                as often as he could, finding creative ways to get to the local ski hills. 
            </p>
            <p>When Skinny Santa was 24, his wife and him had Kid. When Kid was 6, Skinny Santa got her first
                snowboard, and lessons, for Christmas, ironically, since back then he didn't look like Skinny Santa.
            </p>
            <p>As the years went on, Skinny Santa and Kid became very proficient on the slopes, and looked for different
                terrain to ski.  With their adventures, they would come back with many exciting stories to tell.
            </p>
            <p>After Kid had graduated high school, the world was hit by the pandemic.  Everything was closed. Skinny Santa
                was laid off of work, and life became boring.  As the ski season ended, the two of them were thinking of
                what they were going to be doing the next year of skiing, and where they wanted to go.
            </p>
            <p>After weeks of discussion, Kid had an idea that they should look to see if there were any guided tours for
                the type of skiing that they were looking for.  They discovered that there were very few places that offered
                this type of service, and they had a great business opportunity, and <span id="born">Skiing Adventures</span>
                was born.
